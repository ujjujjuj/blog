# Why?

i dont know why i created this thing i was bored ( :( ). i'll probably post technical guides about stuff im learning and other things i find interesting. will also document some of my older projects here so they dont go to waste.

im not much of a writer so these blogs wont be as interesting as other stuff youll find online and i deeply apologize for that (no). also i think that text without punctuation looks cooler.

ok bye
